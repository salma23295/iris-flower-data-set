# iris-flower-data-set
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor),
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
each class (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) refers to a type of iris plant. 

The central goal here is to design a model which makes good classifications for new data, in other words one which exhibits good generalization, So our main goal is to determine flower species from flower measurements
